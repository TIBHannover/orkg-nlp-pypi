Introduction
============
The ORKG-NLP package is a wrapper to the **Natural Language Processing** (NLP) services that are provided by the ORKG NLP team.

Why ?
""""""
The Open Research Knowledge Graph (**ORKG**) is a next-generation digital library that provides
modern techniques foracquiring, curating, publishing and processing semantic scholarly knowledge.
All that happens with leveraging a **Knowledge Graph** that increases the *FAIRness* of the data,
following the RDF triple paradigm.

In the context of the **ORKG** and due to its knowledge base evolution through time,
several natural language processing tasks suggested themselves to be addressed. These NLP tasks can vary from
recognizing named entities in scientific texts to semantifying research papers; or even to recommending
specific graph components in the ORKG.

In a similar vein to the `orkg python package <https://pypi.org/project/orkg/>`_ , we wrap our :doc:`services/services` within the
``orkgnlp`` package!

Please check our ORKG `website <https://www.orkg.org/orkg/>`_ and `project description <https://www.orkg.org/orkg/about/1/Overview>`_ for more detailed information!

Still there ? Great! Now check out the :doc:`installation` section to get started!
